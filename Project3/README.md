# Fall21OOADProj2

Fall 2021 OOAD Project 3 part 2 Code <br />
Most, if not all, Project 2 section related code made by Bruce Montgomery <br />
Observer: for the observer we just implemented an interface with an announcement method that implemented by the announcer class which extends employee and implements the observer interface. And in this the observer (announcer) is essentially just broadcasting all the changes that have occurred within the store.
